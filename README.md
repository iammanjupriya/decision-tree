 Decision Tree Project

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree algorithm for a machine learning project. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results.


 Introduction

The purpose of this project is to showcase how to implement a Decision Tree model using a dataset. Decision Trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks due to their simplicity and interpretability.

Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:

- `DECISION_tREE.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that includes the entire workflow of the Decision Tree model.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to use it.

Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can install the necessary packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install jupyter pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```



Results

The notebook includes various sections such as:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Training the Decision Tree model
- Evaluating the model's performance
- Visualizing the Decision Tree and other results
